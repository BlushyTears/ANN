# ANN
ANN (A Neural Network) is an implementation of a neural network. There are some other complementary functions but not really needed. Very basic implementation: The NN Doesn't even learn from past iterations, just acts upon newly generated values.

Run a few times to get either true or false outout. It varies by about 50% between the two.
