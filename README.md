# ANN
ANN (A Neural Network) is the most basic implementation of a neural network. I couldn't find one myself so hopefully this will aid someone else. Doesn't even learn from past iterations, just acts upon newly generated values.

Run a few times to get either true or false outout. It varies by about 50% between the two.
